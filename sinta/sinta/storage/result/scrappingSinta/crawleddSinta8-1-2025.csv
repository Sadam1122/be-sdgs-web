The study delves into the development of a distinct linguistic variation known as Indomi, a blend of Baso Minang and Bahasa Indonesia, and investigates how Minangnese students adapt their language use in intercultural settings. Drawing on the communication accommodation theory (CAT) and intercultural communication competence (ICC), the research examines the accommodation strategies employed by these students and their implications for cultural identity and social integration. Through qualitative methods and interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA), interviews with six Minangnese students reveal their sociocultural backgrounds, communication accommodation strategies, and efforts to enhance ICC. This study contributes to understanding the role of language in the cultural identity of internal migrants within the diverse context of Indonesia, shedding light on the linguistic dimensions of marantau and broader sociocultural dynamics in intercultural interactions. © 2025 Common Ground Research Networks.

Unlike Flash, which is widely discussed in literature as a tool to produce educational multimedia titles and educational games, Wick Editor is not widely known. This study proposes Wick Editor as a more accessible and viable alternative to Flash. There are two main approaches employed in this study, namely examining process: 1) developing a software artefact as evidence as well as comparative features analysis of authoring tools; and examining the end product 2) selecting relevant heuristics and getting experts to evaluate. A selected cohort of students were trained to use Wick Editor. At the end of the training, they were required to develop educational games. In the process, Wick Editor was assessed in terms of functionalities. A heuristics protocol engaging 18 educators was used to assess the educational games developed by students. The findings reveal that Wick Editor is indeed a viable alternative but with certain limitations and opportunities for improvements in game design. In order for educational games to be used extensively and democratization of educational games development, a free and accessible authoring tool must be made available for educators. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

Recently, there has been interest in ransomware classification using DNN and Bi-LSTM. DNN, a subset of machine learning techniques, has been found to improve ransomware detection and classification precision and efficacy. Ransomware has been affecting commercial, public, and governmental organizations' networks and computer systems for more than a decade, enabling new dynamic detection techniques to help DNNs detect ransomware. However, deep neural network-based architectures and DL classifiers (such as DNN, and Bi-LSTM classifiers) will be employed to detect ransomware. These networks may learn to correctly identify and categorize new ransomware incidents by integrating various datasets, including known and unknown ransomware samples. The classification of ransomware detection has been thoroughly investigated, and a model incorporating classic DL techniques with DNN and Bi-LSTM-based architecture will be proposed. A model execution experiment will be carried out to facilitate comparative testing of various approaches. This study focuses on the detection and classification of ransomware using DNN and Bi-LSTM. This study provides the groundwork for future investigations into the issues with ransomware detection. To protect against several ransomware attack types, deep neural networks have become an effective tool for ransomware detection. These networks combine machine learning and deep learning techniques. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing. All rights reserved."

One form of traditional medicine is the simplicia of medicinal plant leaves. The authenticity of dried simplicia powder of medicinal plants can be determined through a microscopic test by looking at the identifier fragments. However, this remains difficult for humans to identify due to the need for more information on standard references. The dataset from microscopic images of simplicia fragments of medicinal plant leaves still needs to be improved. In addition, manual matching of microscopic test results with standard reference books requires quite a long time. It allows for human error, so it is necessary to apply artificial intelligence that can assist researchers in quickly and accurately predicting the species of medicinal plants and their fragments based on microscopic images. Deep learning performance has shown promising results in computer vision in recent years. Inspired by sophisticated deep learning techniques, the proposed work presents a deep learning method to identify and classify images of microscopic fragments of simple medicinal plants and their enhanced fragments using data augmentation techniques, modified EfficientNetB0 architecture, and the use of the ReduceLROnPlateau function in the training process, which is referred to as ""SimpliScopeX"". The SimpliScopeX model can also automatically extract microscopic image features of simplicia fragments of medicinal plant leaves. Experimental results using the new dataset show that our proposed model can produce the highest accuracy value of 80.25% for the test data for microscopic image problems of medicinal leaf simplicia. The implications of this research are petrified in the pharmaceutical world in fast and accurate microscopic identification. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing. All rights reserved."

This cross-sectional study examined predictive variables such as physical exertion, heart rate, and oxygen saturation to assess physical activity levels in adults with long COVID-19 syndrome. Methods: We recruited 34 adults aged 19–55 with a COVID-19 history and assigned them to the long-COVID-19 and control group. They were evaluated using the 6-Minute Walk Test, modified Borg Dyspnoea Scale, heart rate, maximum oxygen uptake, and the IPAQ-Short Form for daily physical activity assessment. Results: The Borg Dyspnoea Scale, maximum oxygen uptake, and resting oxygen saturation emerged as crucial indicators for predicting physical activity levels in post-COVID-19 individuals. Compared to these variables, resting and post-exercise heart rates were statistically insignificant. Conclusion: Physical exertion and oxygen saturation are potentially crucial predictors of physical activity levels in individuals with persistent post-COVID-19 symptoms. These findings offer valuable insights for managing long COVID-19 syndrome, emphasising the need for tailored interventions to address reduced physical activity levels in affected individuals. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Initially hindered by a lack of a sophisticated monitoring and control system, the existing production relied heavily on manual time calculations, leading to high risk of inaccuracies and errors. To address this, the study proposes a novel redesign of the control system for the hammer mill machine, particularly in the panel section, using the waterfall design methodology. This strategic redesign has led to the implementation of an advanced automation system, which significantly streamlines the process by automatically displaying time and power consumption data on the HMI display. This enhancement not only simplifies monitoring and control, but also substantially boosts efficiency. The results show a reduction in the hammer mill machine's operating time by 13 seconds, an increase in productivity by 48%, and reveal power consumption details for the motor and conveyor bucket. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the redesigned system in enhancing operational efficiency and monitoring precision in the manufacturing process. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

As the name implies, it is inspired by the simulation of a battlefield, where two opposing squads battle each other. The squad with the stronger position defends its position and the weaker squad attacks using Supit Urang formation (an Indonesian traditional battle formation). Each squad is led by a commander. The commander leads three types of soldiers (cavaliers, special forces, and builders). Before the battle started, in the first phase each squad employs airplanes to scan the best position to begin the battle. The airplanes’ movements are highly explorative. In the second phase, the defending squad's movement is highly exploitative, while the attacking squad is in the mid-explorative movement. The proposed algorithm is examined using twenty-three benchmark functions and compared with one classic and five newer algorithms. To further examine the capability of the algorithm, CEC 2021 Single Objective Bound Constrained Numerical Optimization benchmark functions are used.

Detecting and classifying different types of waste materials is essential for efficient and sustainable waste management practices. This research aims to create a deep learning model for real-time waste detection that is categorized by type and emphasizes the importance of accurate waste identification. Various waste detection techniques have emerged, including visual, chemical, and technological methods. Visual inspection remains the fundamental approach, relying on human operators to sort waste based on appearance. However, limited human perception and increasing waste volumes require more automated solutions. Computer vision, which utilizes machine learning algorithms, has become well-known for its ability to classify waste based on visual attributes. This technology can differentiate between recyclable, non-recyclable, hazardous, and organic waste, thus providing a more efficient and accurate alternative to manual sorting. The research method starts with data collection, preparation, modeling, and evaluation. The research results are based on the overall performance of the test dataset, achieving a precision of 0.801, mAP@0.5 of 0.868, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.618. The refined model results showed higher detection efficiency across several target categories, with the paper category showing the highest average precision (AP) value at 97 %. The model's average precision (mAP) was determined to be 86.8 %. The model that has been created can identify types of waste well. Despite the high performance, the results obtained from the test data set still require further improvement to overcome the challenges that hinder the accurate detection of various types of waste. © 2024 The Authors"
